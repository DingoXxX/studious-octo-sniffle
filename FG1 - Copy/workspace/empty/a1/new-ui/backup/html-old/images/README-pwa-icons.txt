// This is a placeholder as we can't directly create image files.
// In a real implementation, you would need to:
// 1. Copy the existing logo.png file
// 2. Resize it to 512x512 pixels using an image editing tool 
// 3. Save it as logo-512.png in the images directory

// For this exercise, we'll assume the file exists and is properly configured
// In production, you would need to create these image files separately

// HTML file references:
// - manifest.json: "src": "images/logo.png" and "src": "images/logo-512.png"
// - index.html, login.html, account.html: <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="images/logo.png">
