# Cash Deposit Implementation Log

## Initial Requirements (May 20, 2025)
- Implementing a secure API for handling physical cash deposits
- Integration with KYC/AML systems
- Transaction tracking and receipt generation

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Core Components Created
- `cash_deposit.py`: Main cash deposit processing logic
  - CashDepositRequest model with required fields
  - process_cash_deposit async function with KYC checks
- `models.py`: Enhanced data models
  - Added cash-specific fields to Transaction model
  - Added KYC status tracking to Account model
- `routes/cash_deposits.py`: API endpoints
  - POST endpoint for new deposits
  - GET endpoint for transaction status

### Current Implementation Features
1. **Physical Cash Validation**:
   - Branch/ATM location tracking
   - Teller ID system
   - ID verification
   - Source of funds tracking

2. **Security & Compliance**:
   - KYC verification
   - AML screening
   - Transaction audit trail
   - Digital receipt generation

### Debug Updates (May 20, 2025)
1. Enhanced CashDepositRequest validation:
   - Added deposit limits ($10k ATM, $50k branch)
   - Added location type enum (ATM/BRANCH)
   - Added ID verification type enum
   - Automatic teller ID validation for branch deposits

2. Improved Security Measures:
   - Added 24-hour deposit monitoring
   - Enhanced KYC verification logging
   - Added verification reference tracking
   - Implemented daily deposit limits

3. Code Quality Improvements:
   - Added type hints and docstrings
   - Improved error handling
   - Added comprehensive logging

### Next Steps
1. Implement currency handling
2. Add cash counting machine integration
3. Set up real-time fraud detection
4. Add branch location verification

### Issues to Address
- [ ] Need to validate deposit location IDs
- [ ] Add rate limiting for deposits
- [ ] Implement cash counting machine integration
- [ ] Add support for multiple currencies

### Questions & Discussion
1. Current focus: Debugging and enhancing the cash deposit implementation
2. Need to verify all security measures are properly implemented
3. Consider adding real-time fraud detection
